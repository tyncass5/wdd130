    <h2>Cassie Smith</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Cassie Smith. I have completed certificates in Social Media Marketing and Graphic Design. I have 9 credits left to 
        graduate but decided to add on the Web and Computer Programming Certificate so that has added an additional 3 semesters. I am 
        hoping to go into User Design Experience. </p> 
    <p>I ultimately want to be able to work remotely and have the freedome to travel more if my kids settle far away. I am a wife, 
        mother and life long learner. I love all forms of art. I love to quilt, crochet and watch live plays. I am not very musically 
        talented so I love to hear others share their talents. </p>
    <p>This is a picture of my family this past year. My kids have all grown taller than me since this was taken. I am now officially 
        the shortest in our family.</p>
